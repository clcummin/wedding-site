      <p>
        Welcome to Becoming Cummings! We are so excited to share this next
        chapter of our love story with you.  Join us for a fun‑filled weekend at
        a secluded resort, where we’ll relax, laugh, and celebrate together. 
        You’ll have access to all the resort’s amenities—take a dip in the pool,
        meander around the pond, challenge each other on the mini‑golf course,
        and enjoy the social events we’ve planned just for you.  Family means
        everything to us, and you—our friends—are like family. This weekend
        isn’t just about the two of us; it’s about all of us coming together to
        make unforgettable memories. We can’t wait to celebrate with you! If you
        haven't done so already please make sure you submit your RSVP.
      </p>
