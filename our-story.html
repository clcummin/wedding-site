              2015. Karl calls for his daily check-in - ya know, fantasy, "business ideas", etc.
              But this time - he brought up a prospect and was convinced she was perfect... he goes, 
              "Bro, she’s got a job and she went to college". I laugh — apparently I gave him the idea
              that was ALL I wanted... Then he drops the bomb: she’s already off the market. This guy! 
              Just a name, a face…and I respected that boundary, filed it away…for now.”

Fast forward to Friendsgiving 2018. I’ve been single for about a year and am very happily off the blind-date train. Of course, the topic comes up. Sunshine grins and goes, “I know the perfect guy.”

Before I can even roll my eyes, everyone jumps in: “Oh, Chris? He’s amazing!” and in about two seconds they’ve decided he’s the guy for me.

Meanwhile I’m over here like, “I don’t know about all that.” But with everyone hyping him up like that, how am I supposed to say no? So I finally cave: “Okay, fine. Give him my Google+ if he’s interested.”

They sold him so hard, I basically had no choice but to give in.

              Years later....daily check-in, again. Karl kicked things off: "Guess what? They
              were talking about you last night, you're in!" I reply: "Who?, What?" (I never
              know what this guy is talking about). He said she would share her Google+ with me
              and I literally laughed outloud. "Bro, either I get her number or we move on".
              So Sunshine slipped Karl Lorraine’s digits behind the
              scenes. A few days later I called, only to be met with a
              cheerful “¡Hola! No habla inglés!” from a coworker screening her
              calls. Undeterred, I sent a hail mary text as I guessed the 203 area code could throw her off. 
              Lorraine, swamped at the office and
              wary of unknown numbers, admitted the prank—and that
              tiny mix‑up paved the way for a six‑hour, laughter‑filled midnight
              chat.

              On March 23, 2019, Chris jetted into LA—armed only with a hotel
              key and zero LA intel to woo Lorraine. His first “date night”
              gamble landed him at a breakfast buffet (he’d secretly hoped for a
              chic rooftop brunch), where he nervously perched at the bar.
              Through the mirrored backdrop, he spotted her: a statuesque beauty
              in long black silk, gliding in like a movie star. After a shy hug,
              the awkward first bites gave way to electric chemistry: they
              chased pool balls at a dive bar, cheered on the Rangers from a
              luxe suite, and capped the night over dollar‑oyster slurps at a
              cozy Korean joint. By the time they parted, it was clear: this was
              just the opening scene of something extraordinary.

            <p>
              In late summer 2023, a contemplative Chris found himself swapping
              stories with his favorite bartender—who quipped, “Either shit or
              get off the toilet,” and it hit him: time to stop talking and
              start doing. With the idea still simmering, he floated it to his
              family over the holidays and got the blessing he needed (“As long
              as you’re happy”). He whisked Lorraine to a jewelry store—what he
              had budgeted for fifteen minutes stretched into a full hour of
              ring‑shopping indecision. On March 7, 2024, ring in pocket, he led
              her back to the Marin Headlands—exactly where he’d first asked her
              to be his girlfriend four years earlier—rolled out a red carpet,
              changed into his best suit on the hillside, and dropped to one
              knee. Lorraine gave a joyful “Yes,” and the next day they toasted
              under a surprise celebration.
