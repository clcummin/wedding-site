              2015. My buddy calls, fresh off a chat with his wife, buzzing:
              ‘Dude, she’s got the job, the degree—the whole package!’ I
              laugh—what did I say to make him think a résumé equals ‘the one’?
              Then he drops the bomb: she’s already off the market. Just a name,
              a face…and I respected that boundary, filed it away…for now.”

              Fast‑forward to our annual girls’ reunion in 2018. There I
              am—single for a year and happily steering clear of blind
              dates—when, of course, the topic comes up. Sunshine grins and
              says, “I know the perfect guy.” Before I can roll my eyes,
              everyone chimes in: “Oh, Chris? He’s fantastic!” Suddenly my
              friends have built Chris up like some kind of modern-day deity.
              Me? I’m a die‑hard skeptic. But with that glowing endorsement? How
              could I resist? Begrudgingly, I admit, “Okay, you’ve convinced
              me—tell him to hit up my Google+ if he’s interested.” Now, if
              they’d hyped him up any more, I’d expect lightning bolts and a
              cape… but hey, you’ve got to see if the legend lives up to the
              hype!

              Karl kicked things off by buzzing Chris Lorraine’s Google+
              link—only for Chris to snort, “Google+? No thanks, I need a
              number!” So Sunshine slipped him Lorraine’s digits behind the
              scenes. A few days later Chris called, only to be met with a
              cheerful “¡Hola! No habla inglés!” from a coworker screening her
              calls. Undeterred, he fired off a text explaining who he was and
              apologizing for the surprise. Lorraine, swamped at the office and
              wary of unknown numbers, sheepishly admitted the prank—and that
              tiny mix‑up paved the way for a six‑hour, laughter‑filled midnight
              chat.

              On March 23, 2019, Chris jetted into LA—armed only with a hotel
              key and zero LA intel to woo Lorraine. His first “date night”
              gamble landed him at a breakfast buffet (he’d secretly hoped for a
              chic rooftop brunch), where he nervously perched at the bar.
              Through the mirrored backdrop, he spotted her: a statuesque beauty
              in long black silk, gliding in like a movie star. After a shy hug,
              the awkward first bites gave way to electric chemistry: they
              chased pool balls at a dive bar, cheered on the Rangers from a
              luxe suite, and capped the night over dollar‑oyster slurps at a
              cozy Korean joint. By the time they parted, it was clear: this was
              just the opening scene of something extraordinary.

          <div class="text-content">
            <p>
              On March 7, 2024, a contemplative Chris found himself swapping
              stories with his favorite bartender—who quipped, “Either shit or
              get off the toilet” and it hit him: time to stop talking and start
              doing. After his family blessed the idea (“As long as you’re
              happy”), he whisked Lorraine to a jewelry store—where what he’d
              budgeted for fifteen minutes stretched into a full hour of
              ring‑shopping indecision. Many months later, ring in pocket, he
              led her back to the Marin Headlands—exactly where he’d first asked
              her to be his girlfriend four years earlier—rolled out a red
              carpet, changed into his best suit on the hillside, and dropped to
              one knee. Lorraine gave a joyful “Yes,” and the next day they
              toasted under a surprise celebration.
