          <h2>Are Kids Welcome?</h2>
          <p>
            Please refer to your invitation&mdash;every named guest is listed
            there. The celebration is at a resort where children are welcome to
            stay and enjoy the onsite activities. However, the ceremony and
            reception are reserved for the guests named on your invitation and
            their plus ones.

          <h2>CVL Cancelation Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Upon booking your hotel room, Chalet View Lodge will require a
            deposit of one night plus taxes and fees. If you are staying for
            multiple nights, they will charge the balance for the remaining
            night(s) upon check-out. If you need to cancel your reservation for
            any reason, please do so at least 72 hours before you are scheduled
            to check-in, and the lodge will issue a 100% refund of your deposit.
            If you cancel within the 72 hour window, unfortunately you forfeit
            your deposit.

          <h2>What shoes should I wear?</h2>
          <p>
            Our celebration is outdoors on grass, turf, and gravel, so please
            avoid stilettos, sandals, and flats. Opt for elegant, classy
            footwear like block heels or wedges that can handle the terrain&mdash;see
            our <a href="attire.html">attire page</a> for more inspiration. Bringing a
            spare pair of flats for dancing the night away is totally
            acceptable!
