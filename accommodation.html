    <p>
      We are thrilled to invite you to join us for our wedding weekend at the beautiful 
      Chalet View Lodge, a premier boutique resort nestled in the scenic town of Portola, CA. 
      Just a 45‑minute drive north of Truckee and 50 miles from the Reno‑Tahoe International Airport. 
      Chalet View Lodge provides the comfort of a relaxed, no‑curfew environment. It's the essence 
      of mountain luxury, inviting guests to immerse themselves in the natural world, and provides 
      a peaceful sanctuary amid the wilderness. It also serves as the perfect launchpad for 
      adventures, from trekking through forest trails to enjoying the myriad of activities onsite.
